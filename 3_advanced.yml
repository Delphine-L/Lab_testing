          <p>
          If we label workflows well, it's easy for us to find useful workflows! Key labels we use are:
             - training (for workflows that correspond to the Galaxy Training Network's tutorials)
             - data interoperability
             - deconvolution

          These workflows relate specifically to the Galaxy Training Network tutorials.
